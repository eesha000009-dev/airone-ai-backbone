Agent: Main Agent
Task: Comprehensive ecosystem testing and bug fixes

Work Log:
- Ran 7 tests on Airo compiler parser: semicolons, periods, mixed terminators, full programs, pin define keyword
- Found parser needed natural-language syntax support (already applied by test agent)
- Ran ESP32 code generation tests: found HC-SR04 missing trigger pulse, buzzer treated as Servo
- Fixed HC-SR04: added TRIG pin auto-assignment, proper trigger/echo sequence in templates
- Fixed buzzer: tone()/noTone() instead of servo.write() in command executor template
- Fixed codegen base.py: auto-detect sensor type for input pins (ultrasonic → HC_SR04)
- Fixed codegen base.py: extract sensors/outputs from new-style AskStatement/ActionStatement
- Ran Deploy API tests: found training takes hours with 19,500 samples
- Fixed training performance: subsampling (500 samples for ES), removed GD fine-tuning, 60s timeout
- Training now takes 32 seconds instead of hours
- Improved Kimi response JSON extraction: 5 helper functions for robust parsing
- Ran AI Backbone tests: found pin parsing regex missing "on pin N as type mode" format
- Fixed database.js: dual-format pin parsing (Format B + Format A fallback)
- Fixed nvidia-client.js: weight dimension validation in trainLnnModel()
- All tests passing: parser, codegen, deploy API, training, chat, brain server, database

Stage Summary:
- 10+ bugs found and fixed across the entire ecosystem
- Training performance: hours → 32 seconds (subsampling + removed GD)
- ESP32 code now generates correct HC-SR04 trigger sequence and buzzer tone() calls
- Parser supports both natural-language and legacy .airo syntax
- Both repos pushed: airone-ide (master), airone-ai-backbone (main)

Task: Fix Airone IDE - Remove Verify button, add New Sketch toolbar button, hide New File from menu

Work Log:
- Viewed uploaded screenshot to identify current IDE state (Verify button present, no New Sketch toolbar button)
- Removed Verify button from airo-toolbar-contribution.ts
- Removed AIRO_VERIFY_COMMAND definition, registration, and keybinding from airo-contribution.ts
- Added New Sketch button to toolbar (purple, with file+ icon) in airo-toolbar-contribution.ts
- Added newSketchIconSvg getter for the new button
- Reassigned Ctrl+R keybinding from Verify to Compile
- Added CSS rules to hide Theia built-in New File, New Folder, Open File from File menu
- Added DOM-based hiding of these items in theia-ide-contribution.tsx as fallback
- Pushed all changes to GitHub (eesha000009-dev/airone-ide, master branch)

Stage Summary:
- Toolbar now shows: New Sketch, Compile, Upload, Serial Monitor, Restart to Update
- File menu now shows: New Sketch, Examples (New File hidden via CSS + DOM)
- Ctrl+R now triggers Compile instead of Verify
- Commit: ac6389e pushed to master

Task: Fix failed GitHub Actions build for Airone IDE

Work Log:
- Checked GitHub Actions: 3 consecutive builds failed (Windows, Linux, Android)
- Identified error: `src/browser/airo-contribution.ts(199,36): error TS2488: Type 'NodeListOf<Element>' must have a '[Symbol.iterator]()' method that returns an iterator`
- Root cause: `tsconfig.json` had `"lib": ["ES2020", "DOM"]` but was missing `"DOM.Iterable"` — required for iterating `NodeListOf` with `for...of`
- Fix: Added `"DOM.Iterable"` to the `lib` array in `theia-extensions/airo/tsconfig.json`
- Committed and pushed: `d549823` — "fix: add DOM.Iterable to tsconfig lib to fix NodeListOf iteration error"
- Triggered workflow_dispatch build
- Monitored build progress — all 3 jobs passed:
  - Linux Build: ✅ success
  - Android Build: ✅ success
  - Windows Build: ✅ success
- GitHub Release created: `v0.1.0-build.202606030110` with all artifacts (APK, AppImage, deb, exe)

Stage Summary:
- Build failure fixed by adding DOM.Iterable to tsconfig lib
- All platforms (Windows, Linux, Android) now build successfully
- Release v0.1.0-build.202606030110 published with 7 artifacts

Task: Implement Arduino CLI auto-install and fix build failures

Work Log:
- Analyzed compiler output: Steps 1-3 work (.airo → C++), Step 4 fails because Arduino CLI not found
- Rewrote `airo-compiler-service.ts` with auto-install capability:
  - `findArduinoCli()`: now checks PATH then `~/.airone/tools/`
  - `ensureArduinoCli()`: auto-downloads Arduino CLI from arduino.cc to `~/.airone/tools/`
  - `ensureEsp32Core()`: auto-installs ESP32 board support via `arduino-cli core install`
  - `installRequiredLibs()`: auto-installs WebSockets, ArduinoJson, etc.
  - Uses dedicated config dir at `~/.airone/arduino-cli/`
  - Platform-specific downloads (Windows zip, macOS/Linux tar.gz)
  - Increased build timeout to 180s for first-time ESP32 core compilation
- Fixed TS2367 error: `process.arch` never returns 'aarch64' (it uses 'arm64')
- Pushed 2 commits: `85bbfa1` (feature) and `712ee19` (TS fix)
- Monitored build: all 3 platforms (Windows, Linux, Android) passed
- Release `v0.1.0-build.202606030136` published with all 7 artifacts

Stage Summary:
- Arduino CLI auto-install: ✅ implemented
- ESP32 board auto-install: ✅ implemented
- Required libraries auto-install: ✅ implemented
- Build passing on all platforms: ✅
- New release: v0.1.0-build.202606030136
